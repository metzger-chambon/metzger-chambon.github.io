# Metzger-chambon lab

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:metzger-chambon/metzger-chambon.github.io.git
npm install
```

Run `next dev` or `npm run dev` locally to preview your work. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Keep the `main` branch as the stable production code that gets deployed to GitHub Pages.

Use a different branch (e.g., `develop`) for ongoing development work.
Push your commits there as often as you want.

Once you‚Äôre happy with your changes, create a Pull Request from `dev` ‚Üí `main`. Review, test, and merge. That merge triggers the deployment workflow and updates the live site.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Improving the Site

Optional: Preview deployments on PRs (Advanced)
You can configure GitHub Actions or use platforms like Vercel to create preview deployments on every PR.
This lets you share a live preview URL before merging.

Vercel is the creator of Next.js and offers automatic preview deployments for every branch and PR ‚Äî with zero config. Super easy.
üöÄ How to set it up with Vercel:

    Go to https://vercel.com and log in with GitHub.

    Click ‚ÄúImport Project‚Äù ‚Üí Select your GitHub repo.

    Vercel detects your Next.js app automatically.

    Accept the defaults:

        Framework: Next.js

        Build command: next build

        Output: .next (Vercel handles that internally)

    Click ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù.

Once connected:

‚úÖ Every time you open or push to a PR ‚Üí Vercel builds the branch and gives you a live preview URL
‚úÖ Merging to main deploys to your production site

# Adding new datasets

To add new dataset, you need to create a `json` file in `public/data/studies` repository. It must follow the schema described in `shared/schema.ts`. Then the name of the `json` file must be added to the list `index.json` in `public/data/studies` repository. The order of the list is the order in which the studies will be shown in the website.
